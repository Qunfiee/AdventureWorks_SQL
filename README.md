# AdventureWorks_SQL



## OVERVIEW
This repository contains two SQL files (Adventure Works 2019) that includes all of my solution attempts for Adventureâ€™s SQL 100 questions. These solutions delved deep into the world of data management and SQL optimization. It was a rewarding challenge as it has not only broadened my technical knowledge but also boosted my confidence in tackling complex SQL tasks

To view the solutions, simply open the AdventureWorks files. In each of the files, you'll find every solution neatly organized with comments or headers that specify the problem's title. Each problem presented its own distinct challenge, providing valuable lessons in creative problem-solving techniques and strategies for handling different SQL scenarios. Feel free to copy and utilize the SQL queries as required.

If you have a more optimized solution for any of the problems, want to add explanations, or have any improvements to existing solutions, please feel free to contribute by creating a pull request.
